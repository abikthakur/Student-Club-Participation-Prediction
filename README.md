# 🎓 Student Club Participation Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will participate in college clubs based on their interest level and availability. It leverages classification algorithms and evaluates performance using standard metrics and visual tools.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

College clubs often face uncertainty about student engagement. This model predicts student participation using features like interest level and free hours per week. Accurate predictions can help improve club targeting, resource allocation, and overall engagement.
